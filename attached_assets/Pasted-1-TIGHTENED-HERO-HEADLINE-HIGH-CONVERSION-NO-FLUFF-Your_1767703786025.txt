1️⃣ TIGHTENED HERO HEADLINE (HIGH-CONVERSION, NO FLUFF)

Your current idea is decent but too safe. We need clarity + outcome.

Final Hero Headline (Primary – use this)

“Learn Tech Skills With Clear Roadmaps — Not Guesswork.”

Supporting Subheadline

“Roadmapfinder gives you structured learning paths, best resources, and an AI-powered app that keeps you consistent until you actually finish.”

Why this works:

Calls out the pain: guesswork

Promises outcome: finish

Simple language → Indian audience friendly

No buzzwords

Alternative (A/B test later)

“Stop Jumping Between Tutorials. Follow a Real Learning Roadmap.”

Use this if you want slightly more aggressive tone.

CTA Copy (Very Important)

Primary (filled button): Install the App

Secondary (outline button): Continue on Web (Free)

Do NOT reverse this. App is money.

2️⃣ PRICING PSYCHOLOGY (INDIA-OPTIMIZED, TRUST-FIRST)

This is where most founders mess up. Don’t.

Pricing Page Structure
Headline

Simple Pricing. Serious Progress.

Subtext

“No fake tiers. No feature confusion. One plan that actually helps you learn.”

Recommended Pricing Model
Monthly

₹199 / month

Yearly (Default Highlight)

₹1,499 / year
(₹125/month — save 37%)

Why this works in India:

₹199 feels impulse-buy safe

₹1,499 feels “investment but affordable”

Monthly anchors yearly as better value

What You MUST Highlight (Bullets)

Include check icons, short text only:

AI-personalized learning roadmaps

Assignments with proof submission

AI mentor for doubts & clarity

Progress tracking, XP & consistency

New roadmaps added regularly

Trust Section (Critical)

Add this below pricing:

“Web version is always free.”
“You only pay for personalization, tracking, and AI guidance inside the app.”

This removes fear.

CTA Under Pricing

Start Learning Smarter → Install the App

No “Buy now”. Sounds scammy. Avoid it.
