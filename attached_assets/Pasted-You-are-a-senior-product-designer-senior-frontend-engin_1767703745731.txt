You are a senior product designer, senior frontend engineer, and brand strategist.

Your task is to design and generate a production-ready, responsive brand website for a tech product called **Roadmapfinder**.

This website is the OFFICIAL company website (roadmapfinder.com), not the learning content site.

PRIMARY GOAL:
- Explain what Roadmapfinder is
- Build trust and credibility
- Convert users to either:
  1) Continue on free web version
  2) Install the Roadmapfinder mobile app (subscription-based)

DO NOT include authentication or gated content.

## BRAND CONTEXT
Roadmapfinder is a learning platform that provides:
- Tech skill roadmaps
- Best curated YouTube resources
- Official documentation links
- AI-powered personalized learning roadmaps (APP ONLY)
- Assignments, proof submission, AI mentor, progress tracking, XP & consistency (APP ONLY)

Free learning content exists on a separate site: roadmapfinder.tech  
This website should LINK to it but not duplicate content.

- Primary colors: Navy blue + bluish gradients
- Accent: Electric blue / cyan highlights

## HERO SECTION (MOST IMPORTANT)
Layout:
- Two-column layout (desktop)
- Left side: Content
- Right side: Mobile app emulator / mockup

Hero content (LEFT):
- Headline (clear value proposition):
  “Personalized Tech Roadmaps. Zero Confusion. Real Progress.”

- Subheading:
  “Roadmapfinder helps you learn tech skills the right way — structured roadmaps, best resources, and AI-powered guidance to stay consistent and actually finish what you start.”

- TWO PRIMARY CTAs (side-by-side):
  1) “Continue on Web” → links to roadmapfinder.tech
  2) “Install the App” → primary CTA (highlighted)

Hero visual (RIGHT):
- Phone emulator / device mockup
- Shows Roadmapfinder app opening screen
- Then roadmap view (clean, minimal animation if possible)
- Dark UI matching brand colors
